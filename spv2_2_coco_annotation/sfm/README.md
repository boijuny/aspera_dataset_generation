This directory contains scripts that are designed to preprocess and reconstruct 3D models of satellites using images from the SpeedPlusV2 dataset. These scripts utilize the OpenMVG and OpenMVS libraries for Structure from Motion (SfM) and 3D reconstruction.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **OpenMVG (Open Multiple View Geometry)**  
  Repository: [https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG)
  
- **OpenMVS (Open Multi-View Stereo)**  
  Repository: [https://github.com/cdcseacave/OpenMVS](https://github.com/cdcseacave/OpenMVS)

Follow the installation instructions on their respective GitHub pages to set up the environments.

## Note on Obsolescence

Please note that the scripts in this folder are somewhat obsolete. For more effective and up-to-date methods of 3D reconstruction using SfM, we recommend using the **Colmap** tool, which generally provides better results and more robust features.

## Purpose of This Archive

The scripts provided here serve more as an archival resource than as practical, cutting-edge solutions. They are maintained here for historical interest and might be useful for those looking to understand the evolution of satellite image processing techniques.

## Getting Started

To use the scripts, clone this repository and navigate to this directory. Ensure that all prerequisites are installed, and read the script comments for additional setup details.
